# Project Name
    Location-Based-Weather-Prediction

The "Current Weather Prediction" project is a Django-based web application that provides real-time weather information for a given location. By utilizing an API integration with a weather service provider, the application retrieves the latest weather data and presents it to users in an easily readable format.

## Features

*  Real-time weather updates: The application fetches the current weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions, based on the user's specified location.
*  Location-based search: Users can input a specific location, such as a city or town, to obtain the weather forecast for that area.

# Technologies Used
* Django: A high-level Python web framework for rapid development and clean design.
* Django Rest Framework: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
* Weather Service API: Integration with a weather service provider's API to retrieve real-time weather data.

1. Install the project dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Create a .env file in the project's root directory and add the following content:
    WEATHER_KEY=**************************
    (Replace ************************** with your weather API key.)
3. Run database migrations:
    python manage.py migrate
4. Start the development server:
    python manage.py runserver
5. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:8000 to access the application.
